# bunny-ui

Bunny-UI is a React-based component library providing basic, lightweight components for small or medium sized websites.

Please note: 
This is a project created and maintained privately by a single developer. The purpose is to use it for my own, personal websites as well as to explore new technical ideas and concepts.

## Technical design choices

Bunny-UI is an ES library based on React and Typescript. The latest version relies on CSS modules exclusively; styled components have intentionally been removed to explore whether a solution without further dependencies is feasible and advisable.

Storybook is used to visualize components and styles.
